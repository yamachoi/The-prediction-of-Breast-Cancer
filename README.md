# The-prediction-of-Breast-Cancer


## 1. Database description
The databases was obtained from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. Samples arrived periodically as Dr. Wolberg reports his clinical cases. The database therefore reflects this chronological grouping of the data.
### This grouping information :
     Group 1: 367 instances (January 1989)
     Group 2:  70 instances (October 1989)
     Group 3:  31 instances (February 1990)
     Group 4:  17 instances (April 1990)
     Group 5:  48 instances (August 1990)
     Group 6:  49 instances (Updated January 1991)
     Group 7:  31 instances (June 1991)
     Group 8:  86 instances (November 1991)
     -----------------------------------------
     Total:   699 points (as of the donated datbase on 15 July 1992)

## 2. Attributes
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. A few of the images can be found at http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~street/images/. Number of Attributes is 10 plus the class attribute
|  | Attribute| Domain| Desciption|
|:-----------:|:-----------|:-----------:|:-----------|
| 1 | Sample code number|  |id number|
| 2 | Clump Thickness               |1 - 10|The number of layers of the smear sample|
| 3 | Uniformity of Cell Size       |1 - 10|The cell size measurement of a group of cells appear in different cell |
| 4 | Uniformity of Cell Shape      |1 - 10|The cell shape measurement of a group of cells appear in different cell |
| 5 | Marginal Adhesion             |1 - 10|
| 6 | Single Epithelial Cell Size   |1 - 10|
| 7 | Bare Nuclei                   |1 - 10|Nucleoli not surrounded by their perspective cytoplasts|
| 8 | Bland Chromatin               |1 - 10|
| 9 | Normal Nucleoli               |1 - 10|No nucleolus, fine nucleolus, prominent nucleolus and multiple nucleoli present|
| 10 | Mitoses                      |1 - 10|Nuclear division in cells
| 11 | Class                        |(2 for benign, 4 for malignant)|
